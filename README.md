# web-scraper
Quick and dirty web scraper to get lessons from a website. Probably not a lot you can reuse for other websites.

It was not made with the intention to be mantained just to scrape once.

I use scrapy to download the files, beautifulSoup to process the html and selenium to interact with javascript. 

This is a starting point if I ever have to write another scraper.
